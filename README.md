# homebridge-broadlink-sp

Broadlink SP2 & SP3 plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/).
Work with SP plugs in your local network. I've tested with two SP3 - works great! 


# Installation
0. Config your SP with default e-Control app (for the first time)
1. Install homebridge using: (sudo) npm install -g homebridge
2. Install this plugin using: (sudo) npm install -g homebridge-broadlink-sp
3. Update your configuration file. See example: `config-sample.json`.
4. Now you can turn on/off your SP device using homebridge, homekit and siri.
